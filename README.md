Title: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

In this project, I performed customer segmentation to identify distinct groups within a customer base, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized services. The segmentation was achieved using the K-Means clustering algorithm, implemented in Python with data manipulation and visualization libraries.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation:

Imported the dataset using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Explored the data to understand its structure, identifying key features relevant for segmentation.
Data Visualization:

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, such as scatter plots and distribution plots, to identify patterns and distributions among customer features.
Analyzed relationships between different features to determine potential clustering variables.
Feature Selection:

Selected relevant features for clustering, focusing on attributes that may indicate customer behavior and preferences.
K-Means Clustering:

Implemented the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers into distinct segments based on the selected features.
Conducted an elbow method analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances against the number of clusters.
Cluster Analysis:

Analyzed the characteristics of each customer segment to understand the unique attributes of each group.
Visualized the clusters using 2D plots to interpret the clustering results visually.
Business Insights:

Derived actionable insights from the segmentation results to inform marketing strategies, product recommendations, and customer relationship management.
Conclusion:
This project highlights the use of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation, providing a framework for businesses to better understand their customers and enhance marketing efforts through tailored strategies.
